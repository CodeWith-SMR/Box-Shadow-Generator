# Box-Shadow-Generator
Design: CodeWithSMR

A user-friendly and interactive web tool to generate custom box shadows for CSS elements. This project allows users to tweak the shadow properties such as offset, blur, spread, and color, and instantly see the results. A live code snippet is generated, making it easy to copy and paste into your CSS.

## Features

- Adjust horizontal and vertical shadow offsets.
- Modify blur and spread values.
- Choose a custom shadow color using a color picker.
- Preview the generated box-shadow in real-time.
- Copy the generated CSS code for easy implementation.

## How It Works

The **Box-Shadow Generator** provides sliders and input fields for users to fine-tune their box shadow. As you adjust the values, the shadow preview updates instantly, and the corresponding CSS code is displayed for you to copy.

### Controls:

- **Horizontal Offset**: Adjusts the shadow’s horizontal distance from the element.
- **Vertical Offset**: Adjusts the shadow’s vertical distance from the element.
- **Blur Radius**: Controls the blur intensity of the shadow.
- **Spread Radius**: Defines the spread size of the shadow.
- **Color Picker**: Allows selection of shadow color.
